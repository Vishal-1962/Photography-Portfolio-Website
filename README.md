# Photography-Portfolio-Website
Photography Portfolio  This is my first personal portfolio, a place where I've combined my passion for photography with my journey into web development. Built to practice core front-end skills, this site is a showcase of both my work behind the camera and my growing skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
